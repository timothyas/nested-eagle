# Updated Mesh

Some sizes:
* There are 73,841 latent mesh nodes
* About 26% (26,108) are in the nest (whereas with the coarse model 58% were)
* If we consider all points in both subdomains from ~53 degrees north to ~22
  degrees north, there are 35,277 (~48%)

## TODO

* [x] Max cutoff for global is 76, that's good to go.
* [ ] Now just need to trim down the max num. neareast neighboUrs ... after this is
      done for the o96 mesh
* [ ] Confirm max cutoff = 24km is good in the LAM region
